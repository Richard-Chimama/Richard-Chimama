ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am here to significantly impact the tech world, focusing on front-end development while aspiring to develop into full-stack development. I specialize in JavaScript, React.js, CSS, and HTML, and I also have experience with TypeScript, Cypress, Node.js, Storybook, React Native, and many more to name just a few.

I combine coding expertise with a strong design sensibility, using Figma to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Committed to continuous learning and collaboration, I prioritize quality code and effective communication.
